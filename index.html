         An at-will, learn-on-the-"job" software development project, that you can use to get day-to-day experience as a software engineer.<br/><br/>Learn to code (or code better) by taking assignments, and reporting on your work as you would in a professional Agile software team. We code in Java, and Javascript, using many popular frameworks and tools. <br/><br/>We operate in two week sprints, and we believe in data structures, algorithms, and code reviews.
